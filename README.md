[2024 update]

- 👋 Hey there, Nik here. Nearly two years ago, I embarked on my coding journey, and I've since made a career transition into the tech.
- 👀 While I still enjoy coffee and doughnuts, my heart has a special place for matcha lattes and cinnamon rolls right now.
- 🌱 Learning Python has opened doors for me, leading to opportunities to contribute to an automation project and conduct sentiment analysis for an NPS analysis. I'm eager to continue learning more about this versatile tool and am exploring the possibility of expanding my knowledge into database development or data science. Truly, learning never stops.
